<h3><b>California ISO Real Time Prices</b></h3>
<br>

<p> <b>Description</b>: I have used a geospatial method (bicubic spline) to interpolate real time prices throughout California. 
    The interpolation routine uses Renka's tripack (TOMS 751), developed in Fortran, and all interpolation has been limited to the convex hull
    of the data. Node selection is conditional on possessing <a href="https://github.com/emunsing/CAISO-Scrapers/tree/master/LMP%20Location%20Scraper">
    geographic location</a>, and I have included supply and demand nodes. </p>
    
<p>Maps are developed in <b>R</b> using ggplot2. More details are forthcoming as analysis is refined. Below is a sample video for the second week of August, 2015:</p>
